# 2048-game
About game:
2048 is played on a plain 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. 
Every turn, a new tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. 
Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. 
If two tiles of the same number collide while moving  , they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided.
The score will intialized with zero after every move if any two tiles are merged then the merged tile value will be added to the score.
If grid is full of tiles and there is no posibility of mergining any two tiles of same number then the game ends, the score until is the final score.
